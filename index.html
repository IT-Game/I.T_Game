            1. The name of the game is Run For Your Life.
            <br>

            2.Our main objective is to pass the course by winning more than 750 points.
            <br>
            3. You have to continuously press your up arrow to proceed up and to go down release your arrow.
            <br>
            4. Since this is a virtual game, all you need to do is open the link and play.
            <br>
            5. This is a single-player game, that helps in your focus.
            <br>
            6. There will be obstacles thrown at you and you have to use your arrows to control your movement.
            <br>
            7. If you touch the obstacle or touch the end of the screen, you will lose.
            <br>
            8. After you cross 750 points you will automatically win.
            <br>
            9. Good Luck :)

            We faced many challenges, some of the challenges we faced include:
            One of the obstacles was translucent, the code required for the sprite to touch a colour and then the game would be over. However, because it was translucent our team had a lot of trouble matching the colour.
            On many occasions, our project didnâ€™t save so we had the hassle of continuously reloading the page and downloading the work.
            We were also facing issues with sharing the project for all to work on at the same time. However, we resolved it by sharing our screen and everybody saying ideas.
            The four pillars of computational thinking guided us throughout the project and helped us be more organized and systematic.

            We broke down our task into 3 parts and assigned each of the team members a role. This helped us get our work done more efficiently and faster.
            Aanya coded the website.
            Imaan coded the game
            Niska wrote the rules and helped in answering the questions. She also helped to edit the document.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <h4>
            While coding the game we realised that many of the obstacles had the same code. Then we duplicated the code to make the work easier. If we would not have recognised the pattern it would have made our job way harder.

            We focused on the coding first so that we could have known the rules better while answering the questions. It would also have helped us to understand how each of the 4 pillars of computational thinking helped us. Without this step, our project would have been very unorganized
            and confusing to work on.

            The algorithm of our project is the website because it contains our game, the rules, and the answers to the questions. This helps us sum up everything we have done.
